# Singly Linked List

Colab with Ken, Yen Xiong, Marco

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Linked List Create a Linked List class Within your Linked List class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. The class should contain the following methods insert Arguments: value Returns: nothing Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance. includes Arguments: value Returns: Boolean Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list. to string Arguments: none Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
Used singly linked list
BigO = O(n)
Space complexity = O(1)

## API
### Linked List

insert - insert a value

toString - returns a string representing each value in the Linked List

includes - returns true if the value exists in the Linked List
