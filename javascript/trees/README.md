# Binary Tree and BST Implementation
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement Trees data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- [ ] - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node
- [ ] - Create a BinaryTree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals
  - [ ] - `preOrder`
  - [ ] - `inOrder`
  - [ ] - `postOrder`
- [ ] - Create a Binary Search Tree class as a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods
- [ ] - Test
  - [ ] - Instantiate empty tree
  - [ ] - Instantiate a tree with a single root node
  - [ ] - Add a left child and right child to a single root node
  - [ ] - return a collection of preorder traversal
  - [ ] - return a collection of inorder traversal
  - [ ] - return a collection of postorder traversal
- [ ] - Stretch Goal, k-ary-tree
